# Project-JS
Project1.html contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for creating a basic clock on a webpage.
It uses a basic setInterval function to make the clock.
Other than this I used BootStrap for getting navigation bar.

Project2.html contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a To-Do List Webpage which lets user add and update iems in their to-do list.
It uses a HTML table to show the list and very basic JS for updating the list and editing contents in it.

The CSS used in both files is inline CSS.
Both files contain very basic JS code for beginners to understand functions and DOM manipulation.
